|  3  |   ✅   |   ✅   |          |
|  4  |   ✅   |   ❎   | Had trouble implementing the recursive solution, but I should have just tried iteration since the steps never go back |
|  5  |   ✅   |   ❎   | Spent hours failing to set up the final loop only to find out that I was appending to the wrong list, but everything else was correct 😓 |
|  6  |   ✅   |   ✅   |          |
|  7  |   ✅   |   ✅   |          |
|  8  |   ✅   |   🔶   | I was trying to come up with a solution that accounts for all sorts of inputs, only to then be told that the input is special and none of that matters 😓 |
|  9  |   ✅   |   ✅   |          |
|  10 |   ✅   |   🔶   | Tried several approaches, filling outside of loop didn't work for me but calculating polygon area did |
|  11 |   ✅   |   ✅   |          |
|  12 |   ❌   |   ❌   | I have no experience with dynamic programming |
|  13 |   ✅   |   ❌   | Part 2 needs a bit of debugging |
|  14 |   ✅   |   🔶   | Part 1 has been the easiest so far, part 2 took me a while to debug |
|  15 |   ✅   |   ❎   |          |
|  16 |   ✅   |   ✅   |          |
|  17 |   ❌   |   ❌   | I would have to learn Dijkstra's algorithm first |
|  18 |   ✅   |   ✅   |          |
|  19 |   ✅   |   ❌   | Stopped here to enjoy Christmas, might come back to this later |
